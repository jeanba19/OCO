This project concerns the implementation of a modified saddle-point method, to solve a convex constrained problem at each time.

The bench.py file is the optimal solution, with full hindsight of the problem.
The olr.py file is our solution.
The traces.py file generates artificial data to evaluate our solution against the benchmark (optimal solution).

Soon we upload the tests file to show how to evaluate the proposed method.
